Path of Go - Golang tools for reading PoE data files
====================================================

This code is super preliminary. Watch this space.

    go run ./cmd/data2json -f formats/demo.go Data/ActiveSkills.dat

You'll need a copy of `Data/` from the game data. I haven't written the GGPK
extractor yet.
